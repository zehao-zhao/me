Hi! Iâ€™m Andy, an graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in the Department of Operation Research Center and Sloan School of Management. My research focus on approximation algorithm for NP-hard problem in optimization. I am working on developing a approximating simplex algorithm for Mixed Integeral Optimization (MIO) under Professor [Dimitris Bertsimas](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/dimitris-bertsimas). 

I obtained my quadruple degrees of B.A./B.S. in Computer Science(EECS), Data Science, Pure Mathematics, and Statistics from University of California, Berkeley. During the time, I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [James Demmel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~demmel/) on Eigenfaces and Federated Learning, [Saul Perlmutter](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/saul-perlmutter) on the [Public Editor Project](https://www.publiceditor.io/), Dr.[Jiahao Yao](https://jiahaoyao.github.io/) on Machine Learning on Finance.
