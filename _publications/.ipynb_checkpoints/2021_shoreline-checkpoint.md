title: "Automatic shoreline extraction and change detection: A study on the southeast coast of Bangladesh"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021_shoreline
excerpt: 'One of the multifaceted features of the Earth's surface is the shoreline, which is always changing and has enhanced economic and environmental values. This paper highlights the shoreline of Bangladesh's southeast coast from 1980 to 2020 with a 10-year interval to automatically extract the shoreline and the changes in coastline position due to accretion and erosion. The findings suggest that in terms of accretion and erosion, the shoreline is dynamic, but overall accretion is dominated rather than erosion.'
