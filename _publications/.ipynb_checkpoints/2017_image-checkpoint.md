excerpt: 'This paper highlights the shoreline of Bangladesh's southeast coast from 1980 to 2020 with a 10-year interval to automatically extract the shoreline and the changes in coastline position due to accretion and erosion. Threshold, Sobel, Prewitt, Canny and Robert generic edge detection algorithms are used for automatic shoreline extraction, including canny's performance in accurately detecting the coastline. The Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) is carried out using Net Shoreline Movement (NSM), End Point Rate (EPR), and Linear Regression Rate (LRR) to statistically measure shoreline changes. The findings suggest that in terms of accretion and erosion, the shoreline is dynamic, but overall accretion is dominated rather than erosion.'
