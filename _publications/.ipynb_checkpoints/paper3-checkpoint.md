excerpt: 'This paper presents Tiny Engine, an optimization-driven inference library tai- lored for microcontrollers, which facilitates on-device training and inference in resource-constrained environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Tiny Engine through a series of benchmarks, highlighting significant improvements in computational efficiency and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional cloud- based and mobile AI platforms by training and fine-tuning an augmented image data set live on a microcontroller with a camera. Our approach leverages a combi- nation of in-place depth-wise convolution, patch-based inference, and advanced data augmentation techniques, which collectively enable the execution of sophis- ticated neural network models on edge devices. We validate our model using a dataset augmented through transformations, showcasing the potential for broader application in real-world scenarios.'
