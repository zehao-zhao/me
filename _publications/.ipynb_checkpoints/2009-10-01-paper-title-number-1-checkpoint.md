excerpt: 'Straight periodic steaks are common negative errors on images, an intelligent method is proposed to test and remove the periodic streaks on digital images. Because of many artificial errors or negative experiment factors, digital images are always contaminated by straight periodic streaks, which will correspondently incur error information on them. By Fast Two Dimensional Fourier Transform, the space spectra from these periodic streaks are discrete and can be test intelligently. After eliminate these frequency ingredient, the periodic streaks disappear after inverse Fourier Transform. The numerical simulation experiment shows that this method is robust in detesting and removing the periodic streaks on digital figures.'
