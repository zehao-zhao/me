permalink: /publication/2020_qrng
excerpt: 'In this paper, we consider the generators based on laser phase noise and propose a method to modify the estimation of min-entropy, which can guarantee no information leakage to the eavesdropper. We also accelerate post processing based on Toeplitz matrix with Fast Fourier Transformation, reducing its time complexity to O(nlogn). Furthermore, we discuss the influence on post processing speed by block length and find a proper block length to process a fixed-length raw sequence.'
