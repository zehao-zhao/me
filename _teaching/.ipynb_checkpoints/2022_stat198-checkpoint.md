This course is intended for students exploring the actuarial career and is designed to prepare students for the Actuarial Exam 1/P (Probability), jointly sponsored and administered by the Society of Actuaries and CAS Casualty Actuarial Society. We will cover the topics listed in the exam syllabus provided by the SOA, including general probability, univariate and multivariate probability distributions, moment generating functions, and more.

Syllabus information such as homework assignments, lectures, midterms and the final are yet to be determined. All homework and test questions are multiple choice and are similar to the questions one would see on the actual Exam 1/P. Attendance is not mandatory (except on exam days), and the course will have a Piazza page so that students will have access to worksheets, homework, and study materials.
