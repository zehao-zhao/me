Course Description
In this course, we will study properties of the integers using the language of divisibility and congruences. We will explore results about writing integers as sums of squares and quadratic reciprocity, among other results. Then, we will study arithmetic functions and prove certain analytic results about the distribution of primes. Finally, time permitted, we will discuss one of a few possible advanced topics such as elliptic curves, p-adic numbers, quadratic number fields, or partitions.
